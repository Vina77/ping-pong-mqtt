# MQTT Ping-Pong Project

This project demonstrates the use of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for simple messaging between two clients. It showcases how to send a "ping" message from one client and receive it on another, followed by sending a "pong" message from the second client and having the first client receive it. The project uses the Paho MQTT Python library for MQTT communication.

## Features

- Two MQTT clients communicating over a common MQTT broker.
- Sending and receiving "ping" and "pong" messages.
- Timestamp calculation for both "ping" and "pong" messages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Paho MQTT Python library (`paho-mqtt`)

## Installation

1. Install the required Python package:

   ```bash
   pip install paho-mqtt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Project

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python mqtt_ping_pong.py
   ```

Ensure you replace `"your_mqtt_server_address"` in the script with the actual address of your MQTT server.

## Building and Deployment

This project is designed to be run locally for demonstration purposes. It does not require a separate build process beyond installing dependencies and running the script.
